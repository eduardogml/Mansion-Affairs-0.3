day1_alex_1_a301bf28		{i}Ruby’s face tightened, and she opened her mouth to respond, but the words seemed to stick in her throat. Daniel’s smirk grew wider, sensing her discomfort.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	529	"[what]"

day1_alex_1_c2f247a9		{i}Ruby’s face flushed with a mix of embarrassment and frustration. She looked down, avoiding eye contact, her hands trembling slightly as she clutched the serving tray.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	557	"[what]"
day1_alex_1_46115a28		{i}I had enough. Daniel's smugness and constant need to belittle others were infuriating. I couldn’t stand by and watch Ruby suffer.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	558	"[what]"

day1_alex_1_7f48512c		{i}I felt a surge of satisfaction for standing up for Ruby. However, Emma’s reaction left me uncertain. Did she appreciate my intervention, or was she feeling jealous?	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	573	"[what]"
day1_alex_1_62561602		{i}I couldn’t tell. Her expression was unreadable as she stared at her plate, lost in thought.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	575	"[what]"
day1_alex_1_b126e3f1		{i}The dining room was filled with an uneasy silence as Daniel and I resumed our conversation. We had just moved into the mansion, and the idea of spending a whole year here was daunting.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	578	"[what]"
day1_alex_1_daeee94c		{i}Daniel, ever the instigator, broke the silence with his usual smirk.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	579	"[what]"
day1_alex_1_e7464584	d	So, Alex, we've barely unpacked, and we already have a year ahead of us in this place. Quite the commitment, don't you think?	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	581	d "[what]"
day1_alex_1_ede7188f	a	Yeah, it's definitely going to be a test. But if we can make it through, selling this place for a good profit will be worth it.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	583	a "[what]"
day1_alex_1_4aad1113	d	True. The plan is solid—stay here for a year, make some improvements, then sell it off and split the profits. Simple enough.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	585	d "[what]"
day1_alex_1_182fd465	a	Simple on paper, sure. But living together in this mansion, dealing with each other daily... that's where it gets tricky.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	587	a "[what]"
day1_alex_1_367d5907	d	And then there's the added spice of this place's reputation. Haunted mansion? Really? Who even believes that crap?	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	589	d "[what]"
day1_alex_1_6a5195ed		{i}I shrugged, the eerie tales not lost on me, even if I didn’t fully believe them.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	591	"[what]"
day1_alex_1_32c0e3e3	a	People love a good ghost story. But yeah, those rumors could definitely make things harder when we try to sell.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	592	a "[what]"
day1_alex_1_931da4a4		{i}Daniel's expression turned more serious, his mind clearly working through the implications.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	594	"[what]"
day1_alex_1_97092386	d	We need to squash those rumors. Find out where they started and put an end to them. We can't let superstitions ruin our plans.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	596	d "[what]"
day1_alex_1_faae48e1	a	Agreed. Maybe we start by talking to some locals, see if they know anything about the history of this place and these ghost stories.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	598	a "[what]"
day1_alex_1_ea2e643e	d	Good idea. And who knows, maybe we’ll uncover something interesting. Though I'd prefer if it's just some old wives' tales.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	600	d "[what]"
day1_alex_1_35024b37	a	Let’s hope it’s nothing more than that. The last thing we need is a real ghost story to deal with.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	602	a "[what]"
day1_alex_1_b1d7805d	d	Well, if there is something, at least we’ll have an adventure to keep us entertained.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	604	d "[what]"
day1_alex_1_bf8eb1da		{i}The conversation shifted slightly as Emma, who had been quietly observing, decided to chime in. She always had a knack for bringing a different perspective, even if it was sometimes unwelcome.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	606	"[what]"
day1_alex_1_b74070db	e	You know, maybe the haunted rumors could work in our favor. People love that kind of stuff—might even drive up the price for the right buyer.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	607	e "[what]"
day1_alex_1_36329a5f		{i}Daniel raised an eyebrow, a glint of amusement in his eyes as he considered her suggestion.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	608	"[what]"
day1_alex_1_d6244a49	d	Interesting angle, Emma. Though I doubt Alex is keen on playing host to ghost hunters.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	609	d "[what]"
day1_alex_1_6cdf910e	a	It’s an idea, though I’d prefer if we didn’t have to rely on ghost stories to sell this place.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	610	a "[what]"
day1_alex_1_07e87d8c	a	But if it comes to that, we might as well use every advantage we have.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	611	a "[what]"
day1_alex_1_3a4f0e28		{i}Isabella, who had been engrossed in her phone, suddenly looked up, her expression one of feigned interest mixed with mild irritation.	game/story_scripts/day1_alex.rpy	612	"[what]"

day1_emma_1_4c35785c		{i}Alex's eyes were glued to me, and I could feel his desire even before he touched me. My body responded almost instinctively, heat rising in my chest.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	66	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_41150fb9		{i}I let my hand fall from my chest, exposing myself fully to him. I saw his breath hitch, and for a second, I felt powerful. It had been so long since I felt this way.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	67	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_41c4c1fa	e	Alex, no. We can’t... not yet.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	69	e "[what]"

day1_emma_1_1d54f5f5	e_	He still wants me. After everything we’ve been through, he still looks at me like this. And what’s worse… I still want him too.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	71	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_c4f633f7		{i}Alex stepped closer, his hands reaching for my waist, pulling me into him. His touch was firm, his fingers digging into the soft skin of my hips as he wrapped his arms around me.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	73	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_d5d50f9e		{i}My heart raced as his hands slid lower, grabbing both sides of my ass and pulling me even closer.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	74	"[what]"

day1_emma_1_e26cd85d	a	Why not? What’s stopping us right now? We both know this is what we want.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	77	a "[what]"
day1_emma_1_55bbfb0c	e	It’s not that simple. Wanting you... it’s not enough to make everything okay between us.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	78	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_2f978596		{i}He groaned softly, clearly frustrated, but he didn’t let go.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	79	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_4b8e8a72		{i}Instead, he pulled me even closer, his hands now gripping my ass firmly, and I felt my heart race.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	81	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_fd6c7fbc		{i}His lips hovered near mine, and for a second, I almost let it happen.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	83	"[what]"

day1_emma_1_3e6618ed	e	Because we’ll still wake up tomorrow with the same problems, Alex.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	88	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_88085e2a	e_	If we do this now, it’ll just complicate things even more. It’ll feel good in the moment, but we’ll still be stuck in the same place afterward.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	89	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_b30acea0	a	So what do you want from me, Emma? What do I have to do?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	90	a "[what]"
day1_emma_1_a3c1a416		{i}For a moment, neither of us spoke. He stared at me, searching my face for some kind of answer. Then, slowly, he let out a long breath, finally stepping back.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	91	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_fb9a4e1d	a	Fine. You’re right... but damn, it’s hard.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	93	a "[what]"

day1_emma_1_671f9862		{i}I watched him go, a strange mixture of relief and regret swirling inside me and for a moment, the silence in the room felt heavy..	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	97	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_6977c822		{i}A strange sense of satisfaction crept in. He still wanted me. Even after everything, that desire was still there. I’d be lying if I said that didn’t feel good.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	100	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_86ea8cd9	e_	But why does it matter? After all the crap he’s put me through… the cheating, the lies… I should hate him.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	101	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_cf80dd83	e_	I should’ve pushed him away harder. But no, here I am, feeling good because he couldn’t keep his hands off me.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	102	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_e49d42c8	e_	Why am I even entertaining this? It’s ridiculous. He doesn’t deserve me. He never did.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	103	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_f6bbe282	e__	Oh, come on. Stop pretending you don’t love the attention. You saw the way he looked at you—like he’d do anything to get back in your pants. And don’t lie, you liked it.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	104	e__ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_fb76d3ac	e_	Shut up. This isn’t about attention. It’s about everything he’s done, everything I’ve had to put up with.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	106	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_47b2ab5a	e__	Yeah, yeah, whatever. But be real—if he weren’t such a mess, you’d be all over him. Admit it.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	107	e__ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_71482bcb		{i}I paused, letting out a breath. I hated when she was right. There was a part of me that still wanted him, that craved the way he made me feel when things were good. But that part didn’t erase the pain, the betrayal.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	108	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_bbeff856	e_	That doesn’t change anything. He’s still a liar, and I’m not falling back into that trap.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	109	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_ad02e49f	e__	Sure, keep telling yourself that. But the second he flashes that smile or gets all needy… we both know you’ll cave. You always do.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	110	e__ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_e5e11b1d	e_	Shut. Up.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	111	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_34391561		{i}I shook my head, pulling my hair back as I tried to focus. I wasn’t going to let this inner voice win. Not today.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	113	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_e792fe0d		{i}Maybe Alex still wanted me, but that didn’t mean I had to want him back. At least, that’s what I kept telling myself.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	114	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_3ce5c51c		{i}I walked through the hallway toward the entrance of the mansion, my footsteps echoing off the marble floors. The place always felt so empty, so cold. But today, being alone here felt... different.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	119	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_97886edd		{i}As I approached the large wooden doors, I could feel a sense of calm settle over me.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	120	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_50ec5f0b		{i}Maybe it was the space, maybe it was just the silence, but for once, I felt like I could think clearly.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	122	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_592969f5		{i}I sat by the fountain, staring blankly at my phone, scrolling without actually paying attention to anything.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	123	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_34bbb04d	e__	Oh, please. You’re just enjoying the peace because Alex isn’t hovering around. Don’t act like you suddenly love this mansion.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	124	e__ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_8e362389	e_	I don’t know. Maybe I do like it here. Or maybe I just like being away from him right now.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	126	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_21113a62	e__	Yeah, until he flashes that grin of his again. We’ll see how long that ‘peace’ lasts.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	127	e__ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_c8d985eb		{i}The quiet of the estate felt calming, but my mind was far from peaceful. My thoughts drifted back to Alex, the tension between us, and the mess we were in.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	128	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_eb9ac161	e__	Oh please, like scrolling through your phone will magically fix your life. You need to stop thinking about him, girl. He’s only going to mess you up again.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	130	e__ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_40090ee6	e_	She’s right. Why do I even care? This was supposed to be my time, my space to think clearly. And here I am, still caught up in it.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	131	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_f03e4b19		{i}The light sound of footsteps on gravel snapped me out of my thoughts. Before I could turn around, a deep voice cut through the silence.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	132	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_d193c1c9	v	Excuse me, are you Emma?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	134	v "[what]"
day1_emma_1_7370c225		{i}I blinked, caught off guard. I looked up from my phone and saw a man standing behind me.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	135	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_1cf2b8b7	e_	Who the hell is this guy? And how does he know my name?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	136	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_8e4dccd1	e__	Well, hello there, mystery man. Is he a stranger or a stalker? Either way, this just got interesting.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	137	e__ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_3ce72415	e	Uh, yeah, that’s me. Do I... know you?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	138	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_29663376	v	I'm Victor. I work for Mrs. Isabella. She asked me to come here today.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	139	v "[what]"
day1_emma_1_9cdfdd94	e_	Okay, so not a stalker. But still, why does he know my name? And why do I feel like there’s more to him than just a guy doing his job?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	140	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_46f91627		{i}I watched Victor closely, still unsure what to make of him. He seemed... charming, but in that polished, almost rehearsed way.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	142	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_6ab568a5		{i}His easy smile and casual demeanor didn't quite sit right with me. I returned his smile, though, keeping up the act.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	143	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_7f9876b1	v	Isabella speaks of you, you know. Said you were full of spirit.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	145	v "[what]"
day1_emma_1_37736606	e_	Spirit? That’s one way to put it. Isabella’s first impression wasn’t exactly glowing, but sure, let’s play along.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	146	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_8b8829d7	e	Oh really? That’s nice to hear. I didn’t expect her to mention me.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	148	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_7a91c7e7		{i}I forced another smile, remembering how my first encounter with Isabella had left me more annoyed than anything.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	149	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_62fd98af		{i}Something about her screamed arrogance, and I wasn’t in the mood to deal with her attitude. But Victor didn’t need to know that.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	150	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_277a6f5f	e__	Of course she talks about you. She’s probably sizing you up, competition-style. Don’t trust her for a second.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	151	e__ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_36bf323a	e	Victor seems fine, but Isabella... yeah, I’m not convinced.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	152	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_8d9bab2d	v	Yeah, she’s a force to be reckoned with in the modeling world.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	154	v "[what]"
day1_emma_1_7a89a5cf	v	I’m her personal stylist, so I get to see that firsthand. Every outfit, every look, it’s a process. She takes it seriously.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	155	v "[what]"
day1_emma_1_4ff6e432	e	I can tell. She has that... perfectionist vibe.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	157	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_fee8c536	e__	Perfectionist? Try controlling. Bet she’s a nightmare when something’s out of place.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	158	e__ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_b34ee7dc		{i}I kept my tone light, though my mind was racing with thoughts of how insufferable Isabella must be in private. But Victor seemed genuine enough, and I didn’t want to make waves just yet.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	159	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_023be03e	e	So, are you here to see Isabella?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	160	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_dac9b010	v	Yep. She wanted to go over some looks for an upcoming shoot. I wasn’t supposed to be here today, but she insisted.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	162	v "[what]"
day1_emma_1_eb47486f		{i}That sounds about right. Isabella seems like the type to pull people into her orbit, whether they want to be there or not.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	163	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_826d2879	e	She has that effect on people, huh?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	164	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_f4bd188f	v	You could say that.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	165	v "[what]"
day1_emma_1_3356ed82		{i}Though I could tell Victor wasn’t entirely sold on the conversation either. I was playing nice, but my gut told me to keep an eye on both of them.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	166	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_3e37386e	e	I'll take you to her room.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	168	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_2333cc4d	v	You lead the way. You know the mansion better than I do.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	169	v "[what]"
day1_emma_1_b6e23b0a	e_	Stylish, charming… a bit too charming, maybe,	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	171	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_5fb3f0fa	e	So, you work with Isabella a lot, huh?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	172	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_e3723c02		{i}Victor chuckled, his smile widening as he looked at her.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	173	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_a96bfb95	v	Oh, yes. She's quite the perfectionist, but that's what makes her so good at what she does. Always pushing boundaries, always demanding the best.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	174	v "[what]"
day1_emma_1_42ef1fd6	e_	Perfectionist? Yeah right, she’s more like an ice queen playing everyone around her.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	177	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_da2052a5	e_	And what’s with this guy? Does he really think I didn’t catch that little smirk?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	178	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_d79c9960		{i}Emma felt her stirring, that voice inside her head ready to snap back, but she held it in. Instead, she played it cool.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	179	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_0b02ee8f	e	Sounds like she's a handful. I didn’t exactly get the warmest reception from her.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	180	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_b28bf557	v	She can be intense, but trust me, when you’re in her circle, she’s loyal. Maybe she’s just feeling you out.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	181	v "[what]"
day1_emma_1_851742a1		{i}As they approached the grand staircase, Victor slowed down, glancing at the decor, seemingly admiring the place. Emma noticed how his gaze lingered a bit too long on certain details.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	183	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_94195f5f	e_	Victor, you’re definitely hiding something. What exactly are you playing at?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	184	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_7370f726	e__	You should ask him something that catches him off guard. Test his loyalty to his 'queen'.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	185	e__ "[what]"

day1_emma_1_9ff59a2a	v	You could say that. Isabella likes to keep things under wraps until the last moment, but we’re planning something big. Should be a spectacle.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	188	v "[what]"

day1_emma_1_6fd27a72		{i}Her voice had that smoothness, but the edges... they were razor-sharp. Her eyes shifted between me and him, calculating, but I kept my cool.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	198	"[what]"

day1_emma_1_cd8a0b12		{i}Isabella's tone was flat, almost dismissive. Like I was the help or something.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	207	"[what]"

day1_emma_1_609e9d7f	a	Yeah, that was a while ago.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	387	a "[what]"
day1_emma_1_7912cdf8	i	You were really something. Strong, determined... quite interesting.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	388	i "[what]"
day1_emma_1_80a9c60d		{i}Her eyes lingered on him longer than I liked, and I shifted in my seat, suddenly feeling a strange wave of annoyance.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	389	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_e9929a48		{i}Maybe it was the way Alex responded, or maybe it was Isabella’s flirty tone, but something about this conversation felt... off.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	390	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_c64b87cc	e_	I swear, if she's trying to get under my skin too, I'll lose it.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	391	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_b62384cf		{i}I kept my expression neutral, focusing on my plate, but inside, everything was swirling—frustration with Alex, irritation at Daniel, and now, Isabella.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	392	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_32c2a904	e_	Why does he have to make everything harder? It’s like he enjoys stirring up trouble. Typical Daniel. He can never just let things be.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	393	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_e4c0450c		{i}Alex’s voice pulled me back to reality. He was talking about his boxing days, that familiar pride creeping into his tone. I kept my eyes on my plate, uninterested. Or at least, I pretended to be.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	394	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_602471c8	a	So, there I was, trying to cut weight while also keeping my strength up. It was a nightmare.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	395	a "[what]"
day1_emma_1_44084050	i	That must have been tough. How did you manage it?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	396	i "[what]"
day1_emma_1_59eee61a		{i}Of course, Isabella jumped in, her tone overly interested. She always had a way of sliding into conversations that didn’t concern her, especially when it involved Alex.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	397	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_107d6d15		{i}I glanced up briefly to see her leaning in, her gaze fixed on him with that look—the one she used when she was playing at being flirty.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	398	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_a090d5f8	e_	She thinks she’s subtle, doesn’t she? It’s pathetic, really.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	399	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_4267f662	r	Excuse me, Mr. Alex. Here’s your dinner.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	400	r "[what]"
day1_emma_1_b5b217c6		{i}Ruby voice was polite, as always, though I could sense the discomfort in her posture, especially when she approached Daniel.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	401	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_efd6f6ea	a	Thanks for the food, Ruby.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	402	a "[what]"
day1_emma_1_c20a79aa		{i}I didn't miss the way Alex’s eyes drifted, but I chose to ignore it. Men would be men, right? Besides, Ruby had this presence—almost too warm, too inviting for her own good.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	403	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_9a7fab5d		{i}As she moved to serve Daniel, I knew what was coming before the words even left his mouth.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	404	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_e75dcda1	d	Thank you, Ruby. You know, I’ve always wondered how someone like you ended up working here. Did you just get lost on your way to a real job?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	406	d "[what]"
day1_emma_1_75fdcfcd		{i}Ruby stiffened slightly, though she tried to brush it off. Her face was a mask of professionalism, but I could see the cracks.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	407	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_3cc4bfc6	r	I enjoy my work here, Mr. Daniel. It’s a good job, and I’m proud of what I do.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	408	r "[what]"
day1_emma_1_7273c686	d	Proud, huh? Proud of cleaning up after us and cooking our meals? Sounds like you're aiming real high, Ruby.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	409	d "[what]"
day1_emma_1_df663018	e_	He’s such a bastard. He gets off on this—on making people feel small.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	410	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_1be82b9f		{i}I stayed quiet, my gaze flicking briefly to Alex. He seemed engrossed in his meal, though I knew he was aware of what was happening. He always chose silence when it came to Daniel’s antics.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	411	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_cd1af2e3	d	Maybe you should aim a bit higher. Oh, wait, I forgot – aiming higher might be a bit too much for you.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	412	d "[what]"
day1_emma_1_ecf82368		{i}Ruby’s face hardened, her jaw clenched as she fought to keep her composure.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	413	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_f9314b2d	d	Come on, Ruby, don’t be shy. Tell us more about your lofty ambitions. Or is this it? Is this the peak of your career?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	414	d "[what]"
day1_emma_1_3e835bd1	e_	I should say something. I should stop him. But... what’s the point? He’s not going to change. He never does.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	415	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_7758d5b8	e_	Is this how it’s going to be? Every meal, every moment, just filled with awkwardness and unspoken words? How long can I keep pretending?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	416	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_75907d4a	d	Ah, Ruby. Always so careful, aren’t you? Wouldn’t want to spill anything on that lovely blouse of yours.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	417	d "[what]"
day1_emma_1_dd078180	r	I’m sorry, Mr. Daniel. I’ll be careful.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	418	r "[what]"
day1_emma_1_1ff06be3	d	You always are. It’s a wonder you manage to keep this place running.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	419	d "[what]"
day1_emma_1_097a6e70	e_	Isn’t anyone going to say something? Should I? Would it even matter?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	420	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_3e9d6441	i	Yes, Ruby. Maybe you should get some clothes that fit better. You know, something a little more... appropriate.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	421	i "[what]"
day1_emma_1_d67ff1d4		{i}Her voice was soft, but the malice behind her words was unmistakable.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	422	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_74853ce1		{i}Ruby’s hands clenched into fists for a brief moment before she quickly composed herself and stepped away from the table, her back rigid as she hurried out of the room.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	424	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_2c7be507		{i}I caught a glimpse of the tears welling in her eyes as she left, and something inside me twisted painfully.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	425	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_a73bc623	e_	I should have said something. I should have stopped them. But what good would it do? They’d just turn it on me. Daniel’s always watching, waiting for me to slip.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	427	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_1b28abb5		{i}The silence that followed was suffocating, the only sound the clink of utensils against plates. Daniel leaned back in his chair, that infuriating smirk still plastered across his face.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	428	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_bc4f5d5d	d	Relax, everyone. It’s all in good fun. Just a little joke, right?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	429	d "[what]"
day1_emma_1_8bd05a43		{i}No one responded. The only movement came from Isabella, still scrolling through her phone as if the whole thing had been nothing more than mild entertainment.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	430	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_540e9b17		{i}I picked at my food, trying to ignore the knot of guilt tightening in my stomach. Daniel’s laughter echoed through the room, loud and grating, a constant reminder of my own silence.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	431	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_e1a39b93	e_	How long can this go on? How much longer can I sit here and pretend like none of this matters?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	432	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_e1d87427		{i}The clinking of silverware against the plates filled the dining room as we sat in an awkward silence. I took a sip of wine, letting the rich taste linger on my tongue.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	434	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_bd7378a9	i	Emma, you’ve been awfully quiet today. Is everything alright?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	436	i "[what]"
day1_emma_1_2d239db9		{i}Her voice was smooth, almost too casual, but I knew her well enough to hear the undertone. She always had a way of masking her real intent behind polite conversation.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	437	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_50c0021c	e	I’m fine, just enjoying the meal.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	439	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_bd2defcf	i	Really? You don’t seem fine. You seem... distracted.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	441	i "[what]"
day1_emma_1_25b9cab4	e_	Typical Isabella... always fishing for something.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	442	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_0328a00b	e_	If she’s looking for a reaction, she’s not going to get it. Not today.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	444	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_5d2b81de	e	There’s a lot on my mind, that’s all. Nothing worth discussing over lunch.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	446	e "[what]"
day1_emma_1_4f7a3f42		{i}I offered a small smile, hoping to deflect. But Isabella wasn’t the type to drop things easily, especially when she smelled blood in the water.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	448	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_d25378e3	i	Oh, come on. We’re all friends here. You can talk to me.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	450	i "[what]"
day1_emma_1_a7befaeb	e_	Friends? More like rivals in this little game of manipulation.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	452	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_400a83d5	e	Really, it’s nothing. Just the usual... life, work, stress.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	454	e "[what]"

day1_emma_1_8c0e9dfe	i	We could go into the city, do some shopping, maybe grab drinks?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	461	i "[what]"
day1_emma_1_8c5968fd		{i}Her voice was light, as if she was offering a genuine invitation.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	463	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_66bb432e	e	I’ll have to check my schedule, but I’ll let you know.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	465	e "[what]"

day1_emma_1_39a25a5f	e_	You’ll get nothing from me, Isabella. Not this time.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	470	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_9487843f	e__	Why does she always do this? It's like she gets off on making people uncomfortable...	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	471	e__ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_945e2888	e__	Maybe she's more desperate for control than she lets on.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	472	e__ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_801f9a07		{i}The room fell into another uneasy silence, and I could feel Isabella’s eyes on me still, waiting for another opportunity to strike.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	474	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_049f5c2b		{i}I took another sip of wine, letting the moment pass. She could try all she wanted, but I wasn’t going to break. Not now, and certainly not in front of them.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	475	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_8649e239		{i}After lunch, I needed to escape the suffocating tension. I grabbed my things and headed to the garden, my sanctuary.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	477	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_7c4adf28		{i}The sun was starting to dip, casting a warm glow over the manicured hedges and vibrant flowers.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	479	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_88158b2d		{i}This place, at least, was peaceful, far from the passive-aggressive remarks and the constant underlying tension at the table. I didn’t need their drama right now. What I needed was to finish my painting.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	480	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_b7a037c0		{i}I had been working on it for weeks, but something about it felt incomplete—like I hadn’t yet fully unlocked the image in my mind.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	483	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_390b17f8	e_	Finally, some peace. No Daniel, no Isabella, no Alex trying to figure out how I feel... just me and my canvas.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	484	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_247a9281	e_	This is what I need—a little bit of control, a place where everything flows the way I want it to.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	485	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_ca4aec48		{i}The warm sun kissed my skin as I stood in front of the canvas. The air was still, with only the occasional breeze rustling the leaves behind me.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	486	"[what]"

day1_emma_1_f9212436		{i}Below her waist, though, she wasn’t human anymore. Thick, twisting tentacles sprawled from her body like some nightmarish creature from the deep.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	490	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_6b232afc	e_	What the hell is this supposed to be? A part of me? She’s a mess, just like me. Fierce, but twisted...	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	491	e_ "[what]"

day1_emma_1_10532ab1		{i}But why? Why was this woman so haunting, yet so familiar?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	498	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_2e721d73		{i}The more I stared, the more the woman seemed to come alive, her eyes reflecting my own inner turmoil. Her tentacles curled as if they were preparing to strike, ready to drag me under.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	500	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_e44aebcd		{i}I let out a slow breath, feeling the weight of the painting press down on me. Maybe I didn’t want to understand it. Maybe it was better that way.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	501	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_30b307b7		{i}I stepped back after hanging the painting on my wall, tilting my head slightly as I examined it.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	503	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_ba2a5cdb		{i}The stark contrast of the black and white, the wild hair, and the tentacles—it all felt surreal, yet oddly personal.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	504	"[what]"

day1_emma_1_7d087a37		{i}The painting captured something raw, something that had been brewing inside me for a while. There was power in it, an unapologetic chaos.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	510	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_403eb5c1	e_	Am I afraid of what's inside me? Or am I just tired of pretending? Maybe I'm both—	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	512	e_ "[what]"

day1_emma_1_887c56b7		{i}As if she were daring me to embrace what lay beneath, the tentacles of my thoughts and desires, twisting and reaching for more. More freedom, more power. More... control.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	516	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_24106863	e_	Yeah, maybe it's time to stop hiding. Maybe the monster's not such a bad thing after all.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	517	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_5166f8aa	e_	What the hell does it mean, though? Am I losing it, or is this who I’ve always been under the surface—wild, untamed... monstrous?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	521	e_ "[what]"
day1_emma_1_e52e20fe		{i}I barely noticed when Alex entered the room. He came up behind me, silent as a shadow, his eyes fixated on the painting.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	524	"[what]"

day1_emma_1_9db063ab		{i}I stared at him for a moment, biting back the sharp retort that was ready to launch.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	547	"[what]"

day1_emma_1_280fd676		{i}I yanked the door open and stormed out, not waiting for a response. Let him stew in his cluelessness. Maybe then he’d realize that sometimes, it’s better to just shut up.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	565	"[what]"

day1_emma_1_d071f650		{i}I took a deep breath, letting the tension drain from my shoulders. Alex stood there, still looking at me with that confused, slightly amused expression. He didn’t get it—how could he?	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	570	"[what]"
day1_emma_1_b7a80d41		{i}Art wasn’t his thing, and expecting him to understand this painting was like expecting a cat to enjoy swimming. But if I kept holding onto this anger, I’d just look like I was overreacting.	game/story_scripts/day1_emma.rpy	571	"[what]"

day2_alex_1_00e93c83		{i}I let the words hang between us, watching as her smile grew, more playful than before. She didn't pull away; instead, she tilted her head slightly, as if considering the idea.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	799	"[what]"

day2_alex_1_9b38b480	a_	Why did I let jealousy take over, not once, but twice?	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1086	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_969b51ae	a_	It’s like I couldn’t control myself, and now Emma probably hates me even more for it. Every time I try to get closer, I just end up pushing her further away.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1087	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_4eb5b89a	a_	I don’t know how to fix this, how to undo the damage I’ve caused. She’s slipping through my fingers, and I can’t seem to stop it.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1088	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_606e0a0f	a_	At least today, I didn’t let jealousy get the better of me like I did yesterday. Emma and I actually had a decent conversation, even if we didn’t kiss.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1090	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_a2aa22b9	a_	But I know one good moment isn’t enough to make up for the past.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1091	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_106c0420	a_	If I want her to forgive me, I’m going to have to keep trying, keep proving to her that I can be better. It’s not going to be easy, but I can’t give up now.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1092	a_ "[what]"

day2_alex_1_2aa4cbd9	a_	She enjoyed it, I could feel that, but there’s still a wall between us. At least I’ve earned a small victory. God, she’s so sexy... the way her body feels against mine.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1095	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_676a323a	a_	It’s going to take more than one kiss to make things right, but I’m not giving up. Not when she looks at me like that.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1096	a_ "[what]"

day2_alex_1_8c558a23	a_	It’s going to be tough winning Emma back, especially with so many temptations inside and outside this mansion.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1103	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_553eee86	a_	Eleanor... I can still feel the way her body pressed against mine, the softness of her curves under my hands.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1106	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_2070e2be	a_	She didn’t pull away when I grabbed her ass; in fact, she seemed to enjoy it. That delicious tension between us, it’s got me thinking about what could happen if I push further.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1107	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_26bc29f4	a_	Emma is already complicated enough, but with Eleanor... I might actually have a chance to get what I want.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1108	a_ "[what]"

day2_alex_1_eda32a20	a_	I can’t afford to lose focus, not with everything on the line. Emma’s already slipping away, and I can’t let my guard down, even for a second, if I want to stand a chance of getting her back.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1112	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_ca9f134e	a_	If Emma ever finds out about Eleanor, things will go from bad to worse.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1114	a_ "[what]"

day2_alex_1_cae2d8bb	a_	I thought complimenting Ruby on her body would get a different reaction, but she clearly wasn’t into it. Maybe I pushed too hard, too fast.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1118	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_f1b7c783	a_	Those breasts, though... damn, they’re hard to ignore. If I want to get closer, I’ll need to figure out how to play this differently.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1119	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_1e77d059	a_	There’s got to be a way to soften her up, make her see I’m more than just some guy throwing cheap lines. I’ll figure it out. Those perfect breasts are worth the effort.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1120	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_b6f2472c	a_	Ruby’s reaction to my compliment was... unexpected. I wasn’t trying to flirt, just acknowledging her hard work, but the way she smiled—there was something more behind it.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1122	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_3db8a841	a_	It felt good, though, seeing her light up like that. I can’t deny there’s a certain charm about her, but I need to be careful.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1123	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_921de92e	a_	I’m already walking on thin ice with Emma, and the last thing I need is to complicate things further.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1124	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_06121b0d	a_	Daniel was a complete idiot for treating Ruby like that. He’s an enemy, no doubt, but I’ll deal with him in time.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1127	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_82a523c6	a_	Ava... After all these years, she still has that spark, that energy. Seeing her brought back memories I didn’t realize I’d missed so much. Maybe this place isn’t all bad.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1128	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_6f02cd2f	a_	I asked Ava about her boyfriend, and she seemed a little off, almost like I’d touched a nerve. Did they fight?	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1131	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_221b4a52	a_	Something must’ve happened between them. She’s usually so confident, but there was something in her eyes that wasn’t there before—maybe doubt, or regret.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1132	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_99c1330d	a_	It’s strange seeing her like that. I can’t help but wonder if there’s more to the story. Maybe she’s not as happy as she pretends to be.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1133	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_73989d54	a_	I can't stop thinking about Ava. When I complimented her body, she didn’t just take it in stride—she practically basked in it, like she was waiting for me to notice.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1135	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_968e28fd	a_	And hell, who wouldn’t? That toned, athletic figure, those curves, the way she moves with such confidence. She’s sexy as hell, and she knows it.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1136	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_49b1b2c6	a_	That smile of hers, the way her eyes lit up when I said it... it was like she was inviting me to look even closer. And the way she was showing off... it felt like she was putting on a show just for me.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1137	a_ "[what]"

day2_alex_1_f9c6b2c4	a_	Isabella… she really got under my skin today. I tried to be charming, to play the game, but she flipped the script on me like it was nothing.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1143	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_10f48562	a_	Every time I thought I had her, she just turned it around, made it all a joke. It’s infuriating, but I can’t help but admire her for it.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1144	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_ac47aa54	a_	And even though I was frustrated, part of me enjoyed the challenge. Maybe that’s what’s bothering me now—I wanted to win, but with her, it feels like the game never really ends.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1145	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_68eab2d8	a_	Holding her in my arms felt so right, like it was exactly where she was meant to be.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1148	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_d0ae529d	a_	The way her body fit against mine, the surprise in her eyes that quickly softened into something else.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1149	a_ "[what]"

day2_alex_1_1ed655dd	a_	And then, after I set her down, the way we talked... it was easy, comfortable, even flirtatious.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1151	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_60aef94b	a_	For a brief moment, it felt like we weren’t just playing some twisted game, but really connecting. That conversation... it’s sticking with me, more than I expected.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1152	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_edf3fb2c	a_	Why do I keep thinking about her? It’s not like I haven’t been rejected before, but this… this feels different. She didn’t just reject me; she toyed with me, made me question everything.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1154	a_ "[what]"
day2_alex_1_835602ae	a_	Was she ever interested, or was it all just a game to her? And why do I care so much? Maybe it’s because, deep down, I know she’s out of my league in more ways than one.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1155	a_ "[what]"

day2_alex_1_b4a547a8	a_	No, it’s better to keep my distance. I’ve learned that the hard way. Let someone else get caught up in her games—I've got enough problems without adding her to the list.	game/story_scripts/day2_alex.rpy	1161	a_ "[what]"

day2_emma_1_0f4f47b0		{i}As soon as I walked into the gym, there she was—Tanya, already poised by the mirror, leaning against the ballet bar like she owned the place.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	112	"[what]"

day2_emma_1_040de72d	e	Okay, so what’s the plan? We going full dance battle or are we keeping it tame for today?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	133	e "[what]"
day2_emma_1_ee21e459	t	Why not both? We’ll start slow, then see how competitive it gets.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	134	t "[what]"
day2_emma_1_6e13680c		{i}She started explaining the steps, her movements fluid and precise as she demonstrated.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	138	"[what]"

day2_emma_1_7f8e28c3		{i}She stepped behind me, placing her hands gently on my back, guiding me. Her touch was soft but firm, and I could feel the heat of her body close to mine.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	143	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_47425bbb	e_	Well, this is... intimate.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	144	e_ "[what]"

day2_emma_1_766ff511		{i}Once she was satisfied with my posture, she stepped back, and we continued.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	147	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_5e450e61		{i}The beat of the music filled the room, and I found myself getting lost in it.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	149	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_5b5f3127		{i}But then, as we danced side by side, I noticed the way Tanya was looking at me.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	151	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_769f858b		{i}It wasn’t just a casual glance—her eyes lingered, tracing the curves of my body with interest.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	152	"[what]"

day2_emma_1_ea7a0fb7		{i}Her words hung in the air for a moment, and for the first time, I wasn’t sure if we were still talking about dancing.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	157	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_3572a702	e__	Okay, Emma. You might want to tread carefully here... or don’t. Where’s the fun in that?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	158	e__ "[what]"
day2_emma_1_4f9a9027		{i}The session came to an end much sooner than I expected. Tanya stopped, breathing lightly, as if she hadn’t even broken a sweat, while I tried to catch my breath.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	159	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_9f1ee191		{i}She looked at me, her eyes lingering a little longer than necessary, and flashed a smile that felt... sincere? Maybe. But then again, with Tanya, it’s hard to tell.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	162	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_0632a4e1	t	Well, that was fun! You did great, Emma. I think you'll get the hang of it quickly. Next time, we’ll push it even more.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	165	t "[what]"
day2_emma_1_b36f3587		{i}I nodded, feeling the sweat trickle down my back. It was fun, I admit it. And... it felt good to be around her.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	167	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_da691253	e	Thanks... I had fun too. Looking forward to the next one.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	168	e "[what]"
day2_emma_1_f12e4853		{i}Her smile grew wider, almost playful.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	170	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_067ecb02	t	Good. I'll hold you to that. Same time next week?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	171	t "[what]"
day2_emma_1_714f7163	e_	Okay, Emma, calm down. It’s just dancing. She’s not flirting. Or maybe she is? Ugh, get a grip. You’re not a teenager.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	172	e_ "[what]"
day2_emma_1_93b90d9e	t	I’ll see you around then. Don’t practice too hard without me!	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	173	t "[what]"
day2_emma_1_222103cb		{i}She winked before turning and walking towards the door, her hips swaying with a confidence that came naturally to her.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	175	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_1a2640ca	e_	Yeah, sure. I’ll definitely not be overthinking this for the rest of the week.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	176	e_ "[what]"
day2_emma_1_70fd9322		{i}I sat by the edge of the pool, trying to ignore the dull ache in my ankle. Tanya's dance lesson was no joke—twisting, turning, all that energy.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	178	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_238cdd2c		{i}I winced as I flexed my foot, feeling the soreness creep up like a warning. The breeze was nice, though, brushing against my skin, calming me down.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	179	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_5f8178cc		{i}My body felt heavy but in a good way, like I'd actually worked out for once. But damn, this ankle...	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	182	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_1e30a8c9		{i}Sitting here, alone with my thoughts, wasn’t all bad either. At least I had time to process. Process what exactly? Tanya’s gaze from earlier?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	183	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_6c840ab3	e_	What was that about anyway? Does she... like me, or is she just being Tanya?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	184	e_ "[what]"
day2_emma_1_b848bc48	e_	Ugh, who knows. But, if she keeps looking at me like that... maybe I wouldn’t mind.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	185	e_ "[what]"
day2_emma_1_11d1fef0		{i}My mind was drifting when I heard the faint sound of footsteps approaching. I didn’t need to look up to know it was Daniel.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	188	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_4b37dd0a		{i}He always had that swagger in his walk, that air of confidence that bordered on arrogance.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	191	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_9e99975d		{i}And here he was again, probably ready to throw some flirty comments my way, as if we hadn’t done this dance a million times before.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	192	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_fd6f4146	d	Emma. Taking a break, huh? Mind if I join?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	194	d "[what]"
day2_emma_1_3da0181e		{i}I forced a small smile, glancing up at him as he stood there, shirtless, his tattoo almost as cocky as his grin.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	196	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_398ebe72	e_	Here we go again. Does he ever get tired of this? Or is it just me?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	197	e_ "[what]"
day2_emma_1_a3e33aa5	e	Sure, Daniel. Why not? Pull up some... grass.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	198	e "[what]"
day2_emma_1_be04120a	d	Rough day, huh? You need a massage? I’ve got magic hands, you know.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	200	d "[what]"
day2_emma_1_119ba621	e_	Oh, I’m sure you do, Daniel. I bet they’ve been all over the place too.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	201	e_ "[what]"
day2_emma_1_3cae99e8		{i}I laughed lightly, but the sound was hollow, almost like an echo of the usual banter.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	203	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_451c0d41	e	I’ll pass, thanks. Just overdid it a bit with the dancing. You know how it is.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	204	e "[what]"
day2_emma_1_47c71b4b	d	Not really. But I’m sure you looked great out there, like always.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	206	d "[what]"
day2_emma_1_baa37735	e_	Flattery? Please, Daniel. Try harder. Or better yet, don’t.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	208	e_ "[what]"
day2_emma_1_4dd44446		{i}I kept my expression neutral, but internally I was trying to piece together why Alex hated him so much. Was it really because Daniel was a manipulator?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	209	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_080d1ac0		{i}Or was there something else going on? Something deeper that I didn’t want to admit to myself?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	210	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_57a10b04	e__	Come on, Emma. You know it’s about Alex. It’s always about Alex. But what’s the real reason? Jealousy? Love? Or just the fact that Daniel is too damn smooth for his own good?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	211	e__ "[what]"
day2_emma_1_4de6bc4d	d	You know, Alex talks a lot of shit about me, doesn’t he?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	213	d "[what]"
day2_emma_1_ab6b98b5		{i}I raised an eyebrow, surprised he was addressing it so directly. Usually, he danced around it.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	215	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_8d74c695	e	He does. Why? Do you care?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	217	e "[what]"
day2_emma_1_a08b28c8	d	Not really. I just don’t get why he’s so hung up on trying to make me the bad guy. You and I... we’re good, right?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	219	d "[what]"
day2_emma_1_12ae9a46	e_	Good? That’s one way to put it. Confusing as hell might be more accurate.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	221	e_ "[what]"
day2_emma_1_6de313ab		{i}I bit my lip, glancing away, watching the water ripple gently. Did I actually think Daniel was bad? Or was it just easier to go along with Alex’s version of events?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	222	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_059c0ed9	e__	And yet, here you are, sitting next to him. If you really believed Alex, would you even be talking to Daniel right now? What does that say about you, Emma?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	223	e__ "[what]"
day2_emma_1_82df78ac	e_	I don’t know.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	224	e_ "[what]"

day2_emma_1_98174456		{i}The question hung between us, heavier than I intended. He stared at me, probably wondering if I was playing him or being serious.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	226	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_5c8735ca	d	I think we could be... better.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	228	d "[what]"

day2_emma_1_0f98ed32	d	I’m serious, Emma. We don’t have to let Alex’s issues get between us. We’re... different.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	232	d "[what]"
day2_emma_1_143efaf9	e_	Oh, we’re different, alright. But not in the way you think	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	233	e_ "[what]"

day2_emma_1_027f760c		{i}I watched Daniel walk off, his promise of bringing a “better wine” lingering in the air. Of course, it was typical Daniel, always trying to impress, always smooth.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	240	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_be4d35f4		{i}But I wasn’t sure what his game was this time. Flirting again? Or just trying to get under Alex’s skin like he always does.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	242	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_d4af7a57		{i}I stretched my legs out, the gentle sway of the inflatable pool float beneath me giving me a sense of weightlessness.	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	245	"[what]"
day2_emma_1_e38a8ed5	e_	Why does Alex hate him so much, though? Is it just jealousy, or is there more to it? And do I even care?	game/story_scripts/day2_emma.rpy	246	e_ "[what]"

day3_alex_1_42e51ce0		{i}I remembered how she had flirted with me, her tone light, her smile a bit too inviting.	game/story_scripts/day3_alex.rpy	51	"[what]"
day3_alex_1_1cc6391b		{i}But I had chosen to politely ignore it, not wanting to complicate things between us. I didn’t reciprocate her advances, instead steering the conversation back to safer, friendly topics.	game/story_scripts/day3_alex.rpy	52	"[what]"
day3_alex_1_0e9612c5		{i}She had seemed a little disappointed, but she didn’t push it further.	game/story_scripts/day3_alex.rpy	53	"[what]"

day3_alex_1_c7d39124		{i}Eleanor was smart, and pushing her away too forcefully might have made her suspicious or defensive.	game/story_scripts/day3_alex.rpy	62	"[what]"

day3_alex_1_62f5cb62		{i}As I reached out to knock on her door, my thoughts continued to swirl. What if I gave in to her advances? Could I still keep control of the situation, or would things get messy?	game/story_scripts/day3_alex.rpy	66	"[what]"
day3_alex_1_199b12e4		{i}On the other hand, keeping my distance might make her lose interest altogether, and that could complicate my plans.	game/story_scripts/day3_alex.rpy	69	"[what]"
day3_alex_1_48f0d032		{i}The sound echoed through the quiet morning air, and I took a step back, waiting for Eleanor to answer.	game/story_scripts/day3_alex.rpy	70	"[what]"

intro_9df003e9	a	Oh, come on, Emma. You're acting like you were any better. You've been cold and aggressive, and if we keep this up, there's no way we'll convince anyone that we're still happily married.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	436	a "[what]"
intro_92f60402	e	Cold and aggressive? Maybe if you didn't constantly pretend I’m still attracted to you, it wouldn't be so difficult.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	437	e "[what]"
intro_70b00b67	a	Pretend? You know, sometimes it feels like you’re the one who’s pretending, Emma. Your attitude is what's making this harder than it needs to be.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	439	a "[what]"
intro_becdabb7	e	I'm not the one who decided to drag out every flaw for Sam to see. If we're going to do this, we need to at least try to act like we can stand each other.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	440	e "[what]"
intro_1faaf9f4	a	And you think your constant jabs help with that? We need to get through this year, and that means putting on a good show. So, how about we start working on that?	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	441	a "[what]"
intro_5d0c082d		{i}Emma sighed, the weight of their situation pressing down on her. She knew Alex had a point, but admitting it was another matter.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	442	"[what]"

intro_50ac4213	a	So, what do you think about everything Sam said about the mansion?	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	448	a "[what]"
intro_34b13e08	a	It feels like something out of a horror movie.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	449	a "[what]"
intro_d635d8af	e	I don't know, Alex. It could just be legend, but these stories usually have some truth to them.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	450	e "[what]"
intro_41f28564	e	It's strange to think that you Aunt would leave us a house full of secrets.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	451	e "[what]"
intro_27c418b3	a	Yeah, and the part about the house being haunted? I’m not sure if I believe in ghosts.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	452	a "[what]"
intro_1db25912	e	Maybe it’s just a way to keep people away.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	453	e "[what]"
intro_c7038a7e	e	The real question is, why did she make it so we have to live here for a year and stay married to inherit it?	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	454	e "[what]"
intro_90752389	a	It's almost like she wanted to force us to work things out. But why? She knew we were having problems.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	455	a "[what]"
intro_1f661ee3	e	Maybe she thought this place could help us find common ground.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	456	e "[what]"
intro_133377cb	e	Or maybe it was just her way of making sure the mansion stayed in the family.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	457	e "[what]"
intro_7874cf97	a	Could be. But it’s not like living together is going to magically fix everything.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	458	a "[what]"
intro_1e9fb7bf	a	Especially with the way things have been between us.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	459	a "[what]"
intro_1073c51c	e	You’re right. It's not going to be easy. Especially if we keep having moments like earlier with Sam.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	460	e "[what]"
intro_12e3a86a	a	Yeah, about that... I know I wasn’t exactly polite, but you didn’t make it any easier either.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	461	a "[what]"
intro_06a6d396	e	I was just responding to your digs. You always have to have the last word, don't you?	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	462	e "[what]"
intro_b158bd43	a	Well, maybe if you weren't so quick to judge and criticize, I wouldn't feel the need to.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	463	a "[what]"
intro_1db1b04c	e	And maybe if you weren’t constantly reminding me of why I shouldn’t trust you, we wouldn’t be in this situation.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	464	e "[what]"
intro_a50b4ba1		{i}The tension between them thickened as their voices rose. Alex turned to face Emma, his expression hardening.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	466	"[what]"
intro_4da0ec32	a	This is exactly why living together is going to be a nightmare. We can't go five minutes without arguing.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	467	a "[what]"
intro_380f86fe	e	And you think I don’t know that? I’m just trying to get through this year so we can both move on.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	468	e "[what]"
intro_781c82f2	a	Maybe we should focus on why Aunt Helen set this up in the first place.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	469	a "[what]"
intro_44962943	a	There has to be a reason, something we're missing.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	470	a "[what]"
intro_789e4523	e	I agree.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	471	e "[what]"

intro_6eb264dc		{i}Near the window stood a plant with green leaves that resembled palm fronds. On the wall next to the door leading to the balcony hung a painting of a young woman sitting on the ground under a blue sky.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	479	"[what]"
intro_17a6585f		{i}The door to the balcony was made of glass, allowing a clear view of the outside.	game/story_scripts/introduction.rpy	480	"[what]"
